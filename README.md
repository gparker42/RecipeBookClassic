# Recipe Book (Classic Remaster)

A [Factorio](https://factorio.com) mod for looking up information about recipes, materials, machines, and technologies, and seeing how they interact with one another. Greatly assists in figuring out complex production cycles, especially in large modpacks.

This Classic Remaster is an update of raiguard's original Recipe Book version 3. Donate to raiguard here:
